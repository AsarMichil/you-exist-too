					One night I thought about one of my friends from back home, and I wondered if they thought
					about me too. That desire to be known, to be missed was strong! And so, I made this
					website.

				<p class="font-mont">
					This website aims to fill that gap between never thinking about someone and thinking about
					someone enough to reach out.
				</p>
				<p class="font-mont">
					It allows you to click a button to say you thought about someone, and if you sign up for
					an account of your own, you can sign your thought with your name. Oh, and you can also see
					who thought about you.
